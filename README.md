# Mario-AI
As the name suggests, this is an AI program that learns how to beat world 1-1 of Super Mario Bros for the NES.

# Details
This project uses deep learning and genetic algorithms to learn how to take Mario to the goal post.

The installation of pyautogui is needed to get the program working successfully. You can install this python
library by running the following command in your terminal `pip3 install pyautogui`

You can test this program using your own emulator and a legal copy of Super Mario Bros on the NES.

On your emulator, make sure to set the directional buttons as the arrow buttons on your keyboard, 'Start' 
as the enter button, and 'A' and 'B' 'Z' and 'X' respectively.

This README will be frequntly updated as progress on the project is made
